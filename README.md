# EdTech-Success-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview
This project delivers a Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights into an EdTech platform’s student engagement, performance, and retention. The primary stakeholders include platform managers, course instructors, and educational analysts—all responsible for enhancing student outcomes, improving retention, and optimizing platform performance.

The goal is to equip decision-makers with a centralized, data-driven tool to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as course completion, forum activity, assignment scores, quiz performance, feedback, revenue contribution, and subscription behavior. This will support strategic decisions to improve learning outcomes, reduce drop-offs, and maximize both educational impact and platform revenue.

## Problem Statement
Despite strong engagement and active participation, the platform faces challenges with low course completion rates (2%) and moderate retention (39%). Additionally, student outcomes vary widely based on career trajectory and subscription status, making it difficult to predict success or optimize interventions. The organization seeks to answer the following critical questions:

- **Student Engagement:** Which students are most active in forums and assignments, and how does engagement relate to career outcomes?  
- **Course Completion:** Which factors contribute to low completion rates, and how can completion be improved?  
- **Quiz and Assignment Performance:** How do quiz scores and assignment completion vary by career outcome or student type?  
- **Retention & Drop-off:** What are the main reasons for student drop-offs, and how can retention be enhanced?  
- **Revenue Contribution:** Which student types or segments contribute most to revenue, and which segments are at risk?  
- **Subscription Insights:** How does subscription status (active, inactive, canceled) affect retention, engagement, and performance?

## Success Metrics
- Stakeholders can self-serve insights without constant analyst support.  
- Informed, data-driven decisions are made across course planning, engagement strategy, and subscription management.  
- Measurable improvements in:  
  - Course completion rates  
  - Student engagement and forum activity  
  - Quiz and assignment performance  
  - Retention and reduction in drop-offs  
  - Revenue from high-performing student segments  

The dashboard is used in:  
- Strategic planning sessions for student success initiatives  
- Quarterly performance reviews  
- Retention and engagement strategy formulation

## Data Structure
The data is organized across multiple tables:  

- **Student Performance:** Course completion, assignments, quizzes, feedback scores  
- **Engagement:** Forum activity, active engagement metrics  
- **Career Outcomes:** Status such as Got a Job, Promotion, Still Searching, Not Applicable  
- **Revenue & Subscription:** Revenue contribution by student type, subscription status  
- **Drop-off Reasons:** Reasons for leaving or stopping engagement

## Executive Summary
The EdTech platform shows strong engagement, with 100% active student participation and active engagement. However, the course completion rate is low at 2%, and overall retention stands at 39%.  

- **Student Engagement:** Students still searching for a job have the highest forum activity, followed by students who got a job.  
- **Performance Metrics:** Students who secured jobs have higher quiz and assignment scores, indicating a correlation between engagement and learning outcomes.  
- **Revenue Contribution:** Employed professionals contribute most to platform revenue, followed by career switchers, unemployed students, and fresh graduates.  
- **Subscription Status:** Active subscriptions show lower retention (28%) than inactive (37%) or canceled subscriptions (34%), revealing potential engagement gaps.  
- **Drop-off Reasons:** Top reasons include lack of time, lost interest, and unavailability of the platform, highlighting areas for improvement.  
- **Feedback Insights:** Employed students provide the highest feedback scores, with career switchers, fresh graduates, and unemployed students following.
